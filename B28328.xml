            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PRESENTMENT OF THE GRAND-JURY, AT Justice-Hall, IN THE OLD-BAYLY, On the 16th of <hi>January,</hi> 1683.</head>
            <head type="sub">We the Jurors, Sworn to Inquire for our Sovereign Lord the KING, of all Offences committed in the City of <hi>LONDON,</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>Humbly present,</opener>
            <p>THat notwithstanding the many good Laws made for Retaining his Majesties Subjects in their due Obedience and Conformity to the Laws, and for the preventing of Conventicles, and unlawful Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, on pretence of Religious Worship, which have in all times been found Dangerous to the Government, and Nurseries of Rebellion; and of which we have lately seen the Cursed Effects in the late Conspiracy against the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Life of our Lord the King, his Royal Brother and his most Ancient and most Excellent Monarchy. Notwithstanding these Laws many persons do yet absent themselves from their Parish Churches, and the use of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Church, with Impunity. And frequent Conventicles are held, in which his Majesties Subjects are by Seditious and Disloyal Discourses with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from their due Obedience.</p>
            <p>Which mischiefes chiefly, as we conceive, arise by the general neglect of Church-Wardens, and Constables, who are entrusted by the Laws with the Prosecution of those Offences: And by reason of so many Nonconformists Preachers who walk, up and down the streets openly, and reside within the said City, contrary to the known Laws.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>We do therefore earnestly Pray that this Honorable Court, would be pleased to take effectual care, that the said Laws be duly and strictly executed; And that the Constables and Church-war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens be required for the future, faithfully and diligently, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their respective capacities, to perform their Duties, according to their Oaths, and the Laws in that behalf provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And we farther take notice of the too great and general abuse of the Lords-Day, by the great resort of persons to Taverns, Cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee-Houses, and Tippling-Houses, especially in time of Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and Sermon. And therefore pray that you would be pleased to cause the said Officers to do their Duties therein likewise.</p>
